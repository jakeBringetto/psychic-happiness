# Costs

## Overview

Generally, the financials are not a huge issue, but there are some subproblems to sort out. The UCEAP program makes the tuition manageable - housing to be figured out. The issues involved are the travel costs, lifestyle costs, and most importantly the Berkeley lease problem.

### Expense Estimate

&#x20;UC Tuition: $6,285&#x20;

UCEAP Fees: $2,300&#x20;

Campus Fees: $800&#x20;

Pre-departure Expenses: $800&#x20;

Incidentals, Books, and Transportation: $600&#x20;

Housing and Meals: $4,000&#x20;

Airfare (round-trip, changeable): $1,100

TOTAL COST: $15,885

### Berkeley Lease Problem:

Lease is yearly - thus I would be paying for Jan-June without living there. 1500 \* 6 = 9000 extra dollars. The only solution would be to find someone to sublet the room and pay rent, or at least discounted rent. If I could eliminate this cost, the trip would be more feasible.

### Strategies:

Solving the lease problem is a matter of finding a new tenant and getting approval from other housemates. Additionally, financial aid still applies (need to see the details here). Another potential cost reduction is the Global Scholarship ($2000), which I have seen is given to many students who apply for it.
